# branch plans

- OBspawn:
    - spawning of obs
    - moving obs based on the rotation speed
    - adding collision to the player
    - creating the mighty *infinite loop*

    if possible:
    - moving obs
    - color spill on the obs upon collision
    - saving ob pattern to return upon respawn (will be done on the game event branch)

- Events:
    - handing an start button
    - death state
    - keeping track of score

- Touches:
    - flashing background upon start and death
    - using the ob pattern to retain upon dieing 
    - saving the top score
- crazy touches:
    - saving top score on a server with their names ðŸ’¾
    - adding online battles and races ðŸŽ®
    - a web version ? [maybe] ðŸ•¸
